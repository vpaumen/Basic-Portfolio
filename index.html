        <p> My name is Victor Paumen, this is my first attempt at a portfolio page. 
            I am pursuing the GW Coder Bootcamp and hope to be working in this exciting field shortly.
            I will keep you posted with my latest projects and there will be samples to show you.
            We are kicking off our learning by learning and mastering HTML and CSS. Markup language and syling is a very important part of design.
            Then we will move on to JavaScript to add that Wow! factor to our sites, this will be challenging for me as I have not had any exposure to it in the past.
            I am excited to learn all these new applications and tools and look forward to making my portofolio pop.
            Thank you for visiting my site and if you would like to contact me please visit the contact.
